# CLOUD COMPUTING

## Serverless computing

- FAAS
    -> Mention that there is no communication between faas, so there must exist a process in which they can communicate
- Inter-process comminication: how do miscroservices communicate (I want to get to the point where I can say the best way to achieve this is using pub/sub systems)
